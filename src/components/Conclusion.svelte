        <h2>So all cats are lazy?</h2>

                Do you have a cat that spends 15 hours a day sleeping?
                According to this study, you’re not alone. The
                good news? What looks like laziness is usually quite normal cat
                behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wild ancestors of pet cats had to hunt their food which requires
                patience and conserving energy for explosive runs and intense
                moments during a hunt. Domestic cats still follow these ancient
                patterns where they go through short bursts of play or
                exploration followed by quite a lot of napping. There are also
                differences in breeds or individual personalities that mean some
                cats are less active than others.

                However, sometimes “lazy” behaviour can signal that something
                might be wrong. For example, if a cat is suddenly much less
                active, gains weight fast or shows other health issues. Low
                energy levels can also stem from a lack of stimulation, or too
                much or the wrong food. While napping most of the time is
                perfectly normal for cats, it’s good know the difference between
                normal cat relaxation and potential problems that need
                attention.
