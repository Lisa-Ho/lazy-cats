                However, sometimes the laziness can stem from a lack of
                stimulation. Cats are naturally curious and active animals, but
                if they don’t have enough toys or activities to keep them
                occupied, they can become bored and appear lethargic. Without
                proper mental stimulation, cats will often sleep more than
                usual, which gives off the impression that they’re lazy.
