                The study by Smit and others used accelerometers to collect
                movement data from Lily and 27 other cats for 1 week in summer
                and 1 week in winter 2023. They then applied a machine learning
                model to determine whether cats were being active, eating,
                grooming, littering, lying, scratching, sitting or standing.

                According to the study, cats spend the majority of their time
                (86%) displaying inactive behavious â€” lying, sitting or
                standing. In fact, those are the top 3 activities across both
                seasons for all cats. However, a few cats spend a notable amount
                of time eating in winter or grooming in summer.

                On average, the cats in the study spend 37% of their time
                sitting and another 37% lying. Cats like Lily who live together with
                other cats spend slightly less time lying and more time sitting.
                Cats spend another 13% of their day standing, less time on
                grooming (6%), eating (6%), being active (3%), and very
                little time on scratching or littering.
